# Issues

Nested circuits

- How to include the file and import into the @chips hash
- How to prevent ID conflict? Might need UUID after all
- May apply unique ID to the entire (sub)circuit

Textual front-end

- DNE :(
- All grammars investigated thus far are horribad
- May need to build a custom grammar with TreeTop - do I have time to learn this?

Non-trivial test data

- Some basic gates, NAND logic, simple circuits exist now
- Need tests for nesting

# Nice to Have

- Truth table is now available, though ugly
