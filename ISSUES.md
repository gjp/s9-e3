# Issues. Issues?

# Issues.

- Code follows the Big Ball o' Mud pattern.
- Steve's builder has not been full digested.
- No tests. Should at least have a sanity check for a known circuit.
- Truth table is unformatted.
- Currently no JSON output. This requires a rethink.

## Other than that, everything works _great_.
